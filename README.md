Memory Card Game
This is a fun and interactive memory card game built with React.

Shuffling the Cards: I used the Fisher-Yates algorithm to ensure the cards shuffle randomly every time, keeping the game fair and unpredictable.

State Management: Reactâ€™s useState and useEffect handle the game logic, like updating scores and resetting the game, so everything runs smoothly.

Responsive Design: The game works great on different screen sizes, tested and tweaked using Chrome DevTools.

Smooth Interactions: Added CSS transitions for hover effects and background changes to make the game more engaging.
